## Client Discovery (from Call Transcript)

### Core Pain Points
1. **Scattered Communication**: Email + paper + word-of-mouth → surprise work, surprise invoices
2. **Lack of Single Source of Truth**: Decisions buried in inbox threads
3. **Invoice Problems**: Vendors send invoices with just dollar amounts (no details, no location)
4. **Multiple Campuses, Multiple Funding Sources**: 3 campuses, each with different funding → need split invoicing
5. **Historic Sites**: Require detailed documentation (down to nail types) for future audits
6. **Contractor Confusion**: Multiple subs sending invoices directly (should be one accountable party)

### Client Requirements (Repeated)
1. Track: Quote → Approval → Schedule → Done → Invoice (no work starts without approval)
2. Invoices: Detailed (what work, which location) + split by campus/funding source
3. Historic documentation: Materials, methods, photos, architect guidance
4. One counterparty: Pelican State invoices client; pays subs internally
5. Visibility: Schedule, delays, blockers (esp. for construction projects)
6. Initial deliverable: Site-by-site backlog with scope + priorities + rough costs

### Types of Work
- **Small tasks**: Mirrors, painting, minor repairs
- **Event support**: Facility support on specific dates (hours/rate)
- **Construction projects**: Milestones, schedule, progress updates

### Three Campuses
- **Wallace**: Historic site being remodeled (behind schedule, over budget) — HIGH PRIORITY
- **Woodland (Laplace)**: Historic site opening to public Oct 2026 — HIGH PRIORITY
- **Third site (Plaquemine Parish)**: Just acquired, maintenance only — LOW PRIORITY

### Workflow Expectations
1. Site walkthrough → create list of work needed
2. Scope + estimate → client approval
3. Cannot be scheduled until approved
4. Weekly/monthly updates on progress
5. Invoices submitted (weekly/monthly) → approved Fridays → paid
